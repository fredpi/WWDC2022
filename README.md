# Integration

This app offers a **playground-book like interactive introduction into the topic of integration and (especially) numerical integration**. It's my entry to the WWDC 2022 Swift Student Challenge and was only created in a weekend's time â€“ meaning code quality, code structure and the underlaying modeling don't live up to professional standards everywhere.

The app is best run on a 12.9" iPad Pro via Xcode. To run the app, it is needed  to select a development team in Xcode first.
